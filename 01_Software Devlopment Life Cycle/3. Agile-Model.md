# 📘 Agile Model

The **Agile Model** is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that emphasizes **collaboration**, **adaptability**, and **incremental progress**.

---

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Developers create a **prototype** based on initial requirements and send it to the client.
2. If there are still any changes needs to be done in the initial requirements, the client is able to send the new requirements with the feedback.
3. This creates a continuous **feedback loop** between clients and developers.
4. This entire process of software development is broken into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints, which typically last 1-4 weeks. 
5. Each sprint includes key phases: **Analyze → Plan → Design → Code → Test → Review**
6. At the end of each sprint, a functional part of the software is delivered, allowing for regular feedback and adjustments.

## 🧱 Agile Frameworks

Agile is not a single methodology but a set of principles. Common frameworks include:

* **Scrum**: Focuses on Fixed-length sprints, stand-ups, reviews and retrospectives
* **Kanban**: Visual boards to manage work-in-progress
* **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Emphasizes Technical excellence, CI, frequent releases

📝 *Out of all above, Scrum is the most widely used Agile framework.*

## 🧩 Scrum Framework

Scrum is designed to help teams work collaboratively to deliver high-quality products.
It focuses on organizing work into fixed-length time periods called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks, during which specific goals are achieved.

### 🔑 Key Components of Scrum

**1. Roles:**

* **Product Owner**: Defines the product vision, manages the product backlog, and prioritizes tasks to maximize value.
* **Scrum Master**: FFacilitates the Scrum process, ensures adherence to Scrum principles, and removes obstacles for the team.
* **Development Team**: Delivers working software each sprint.

**2. Artifacts:**

* **Product Backlog**: A prioritized list of all features, requirements, and tasks for the product.
* **Sprint Backlog**: A subset of the product backlog, representing tasks selected for a specific sprint.
* **Increment**: A functional, tested, and deliverable portion of the product at the end of each sprint.

**3. Events:**

* **Sprint Planning**: A meeting at the beginning of each sprint to define the sprint goal and select tasks from the backlog.
* **Daily Scrum (Stand-up)**: A short daily meeting (15 minutes) to review progress and address roadblocks.
* **Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of the sprint to demonstrate the completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.
* **Sprint Retrospective**: A discussion after the sprint to evaluate what went well, what didn’t, and how to improve in the next sprint.

## 🔁 Scrum Workflow

1. **Product Backlog**: Product Owner creates and maintains the Product Backlog, a prioritized list of tasks, features, and requirements for the product.
2. **Sprint Planning**: Scrum Team decide which tasks from the Product Backlog will be worked on in the upcoming Sprint.
3. **Sprint**: Execution phase (1–4 weeks): The team works on the selected tasks over a 1–4 week period. The work is carried out in small increments.
4. **Daily Stand-ups**: A daily meeting where the team discusses progress, challenges, and plans for the day.
5. **Sprint Review**: At the end of the Sprint, the team presents the completed work to the Product Owner and stakeholders to gather feedback.
6. **Retrospective**: The team discusses what went well, what didn’t, and how they can improve their processes for the next Sprint.
7. **Related Work**: The deliverables or completed work are finalized and prepared for review or deployment.

## ✅ Key Principles of Agile

1. **Customer Collaboration**: Continuous involvement of stakeholders to ensure the product meets their needs.
2. **Iterative Development**: Work is done in small cycles, enabling frequent reassessment and refinement.
3. **Adaptive Planning**: Plans are dynamic and adjusted based on ongoing feedback and project needs.
4. **Value-Driven Delivery**: Focus on delivering high-priority features first.
5. **Cross-Functional Teams**: Teams include developers, testers, designers, and business analysts working collaboratively.
6. **Simplicity**: Focus on delivering only what is necessary for the current iteration.

## 💡 Benefits of Agile

* **Faster Delivery**: Regular releases ensure quicker time-to-market.
* **Improved Quality**: Continuous testing and feedback lead to fewer defects.
* **Flexibility**: Easily adapts to changing requirements
* **Better Collaboration**: All stakeholders involved
* **High Customer Satisfaction**: Regular updates and user involvement ensure alignment with expectations.

Agile helps teams adapt to uncertainty and ensures the final product closely aligns with user needs.
However, while the development team (Dev) work closely together and collaborate with product owners and other stakeholders, operations teams often operate in a more isolated manner. 
And this separation can lead to certain DRAWBACKS:

## ⚠️ The Dev–Ops Gap in Agile

Even with Agile, Dev and Ops teams are often **siloed**, which causes:

* **Delayed Deployments** : Developers may complete their tasks, but operations teams might face issues while deploying or managing the software in production.
* **Environment Inconsistencies** : Development and production environments might differ, leading to "it works on my machine" issues.
* **Slow Feedback from Production Issues** : Without collaboration between Dev and Ops, any feedback regarding production issues might not reach developers quickly enough, causing delays in fixing problems or rolling out updates.

The gap or miscommunication between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) is not necessarily a direct drawback of Agile methodology itself,
but rather a challenge that arises due to the separation of concerns between these two teams.
And to overcome this Gap or Miscommunication between DevOps came in picture.

## 🔧 	How DevOps Overcomes This Gap in Agile

DevOps evolved from Agile to bring Dev and Ops together:
* Promotes **collaboration** between development and operations
* Enables **automation** of deployment and infrastructure
* Ensures **shared responsibility** for quality and delivery

> DevOps is a **natural extension** of Agile that helps teams deliver software faster, more reliably, and with better coordination.
