# 📘 Waterfall Model

The **Waterfall Model** is one of the earliest and most traditional models in software development. It is a **linear and sequential** approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.

## 🔁 Phases in the Waterfall Model

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - All requirements of the project are gathered and documented.

2. **System Design**
   - A blueprint for the software is prepared, covering architecture and UI.

3. **Implementation (Coding)**
   - Developers write code based on the finalized designs.

4. **Testing**
   - Code is tested against the requirements to identify and fix bugs.

5. **Deployment**
   - The working software is released to production or customers.

6. **Maintenance**
   - Fixing bugs or making updates after deployment.

## 🚫 Drawbacks of the Waterfall Model

- Requirements must be clearly defined upfront — changes are hard to accommodate later.
- Feedback is delayed until the testing phase.
- Poor visibility of progress across stages.
- Not suitable for complex, long-term, or evolving projects.

## ✅ When to Use

- Projects with very well-understood requirements.
- Regulatory/government contracts where process documentation is critical.
