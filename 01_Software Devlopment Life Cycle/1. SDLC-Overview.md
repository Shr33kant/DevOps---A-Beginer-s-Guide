# 📘 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) – Overview

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used by development teams to build high-quality software in a methodical and efficient manner.
It defines a clear path for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system, from inception to completion.

---

## 🚀 Why Do We Need SDLC?

- To bring **structure and discipline** to software development
- To ensure **customer requirements are clearly understood**
- To deliver **quality software within time and budget**
- To help teams follow a **repeatable, predictable process**
- To reduce **waste, rework, and errors** during development

---

## 🧱 SDLC Models

There are several ways to implement SDLC — each with its pros and cons:

- **Waterfall** (sequential, rigid)
- **Agile** (iterative, flexible)
- **V-Model**
- **Spiral**
- **Big Bang**
- **DevOps** (extends Agile with operations automation)

👉 Each model defines how and when the SDLC phases are executed.

## 🔍 Real-World Relevance

Even in modern Agile and DevOps workflows, SDLC principles still apply — just with shorter, faster cycles and automation.

- DevOps automates many SDLC phases using tools (e.g., CI/CD in deployment)
- Agile keeps the same phases but executes them in every sprint
- Without SDLC, projects often fail due to scope creep, poor planning, and weak testing

---

## ✅ Summary

- SDLC is the **foundation** of structured software development.
- It helps align business goals, development activities, and quality assurance.
- Even with Agile and DevOps, SDLC thinking remains essential.
