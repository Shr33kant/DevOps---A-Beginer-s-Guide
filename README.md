# 📘 Traditional SDLC to DevOps Evolution Guide

This repository is a structured collection of notes based on my study of software development life cycle models, Agile methodologies, and the evolution into DevOps practices. 
DevOps is not just a methodology, Its a mindset. So, before we began our DevOps Learning Journey we should understand how it came in picture.
It also covers CI/CD concepts, all explained in beginner-friendly language.

This documentation helps consolidate my understanding of:
- The evolution from traditional software development to Agile and then to DevOps
- The lifecycle and principles of DevOps
- The structure and tools involved in a CI/CD pipeline
- How CI/CD works together?
