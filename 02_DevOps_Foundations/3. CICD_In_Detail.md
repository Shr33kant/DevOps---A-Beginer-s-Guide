# 🚀 CI/CD: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment

**CI/CD** is a key DevOps practice that **automates software delivery**, improves software quality, and accelerates release cycles. 
It stands for:

- **CI** → Continuous Integration
- **CD** → Continuous Delivery and/or Continuous Deployment

---

## 📌 Where Does CI/CD Fit in the DevOps Lifecycle?

The DevOps lifecycle consists of multiple phases:

`Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor`

➡️ **CI/CD primarily fits into the middle section** of this loop:
- **CI (Continuous Integration)** fits within **Develop → Build → Test**
- **CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment)** fits within **Release → Deploy**

> CI ensures that code is tested and integrated continuously.
> CD ensures that tested code is delivered or deployed frequently and reliably.

**Now, let’s understand CI/CD process in detail:**

## 🔧 What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

**Continuous Integration** is the process where developers **frequently push their code changes** to a shared repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). 
Every push triggers **automated builds and tests**, ensuring the new code integrates well with the existing codebase.

### ✅ Objectives of CI:
- **Catch bugs early** through automated testing
- **Improve collaboration** by integrating changes frequently
- **Provide fast feedback** to developers if the new code causes an issue
- **Ensure the codebase is always in a workable state**

### 🛠️ Popular CI Tools:
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io)
- [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com)
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)

## 📦 What is Continuous Delivery (CD)?

**Continuous Delivery** extends CI by ensuring that the application is always in a deployable state
**Every change that passes automated tests** is automatically pushed to a staging or pre-production environment. 
This ensures that every code change is automatically tested and prepared for release into production. 
However, actual deployment to production requires **manual approval**.

### ✅ Objectives of CD:
- **Speed up delivery** Frequent releases make features available to end-users faster
- **Reduce Risk** Testing and staging environments mimic production, ensuring safe releases.
- **Improve Reliability** Automated pipelines minimize human error.

> Continuous Delivery ensures that software is always **ready for deployment**, but the final push to production still requires **manual approval**.

## 🔄 What is Continuous Deployment (CD)?

**Continuous Deployment** takes automation one step further. 
Every change that passes tests is **automatically deployed to production** —without waiting for manual approval.

### ✅ Objectives of Continuous Deployment:
- **Full automation** Eliminates manual steps for faster releases
- **Rapid updates** New features or fixes are delivered to end users without delays
- **Fast iteration** Teams can iterate and respond to feedback quickly ensuring real-time delivery of new features

## ⚖️ Difference Between Continuous Delivery and Deployment

The terms Continuous Delivery (CD) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are often used interchangeably.
But they represent different levels of automation and practices in the software development lifecycle. 
Both are part of the DevOps pipeline and focus on delivering software changes more frequently and reliably.
But the key distinction lies in the extent of automation and the manual intervention as explained above.

## ⚖️ When to Use Which?

### ✅ Use **Continuous Delivery** when:
- Your business needs control over the release process i.e. **manual approvals** is required.
- You're in a **regulated industry** (e.g., healthcare, banking)
- The business requires coordination with non-technical teams (e.g., marketing or sales)

🧪 **Example**: A new feature passes all automated tests and is ready for production deployment, but it is held back until the marketing team schedules a launch or a specific customer request is processed.

---

### ✅ Use **Continuous Deployment** when:
- Your product demands frequent updates, like in  **SaaS**, **e-commerce**, or **web apps**
- In environments where **rapid user feedback** is essential for iterative development    
- You have **robust automated testing** in place

🧪 **Example**: A bug fix is automatically deployed to production after passing tests, reaching users instantly, allowing them to see the changes without any delays.

## 🔄 How CI/CD Works Together – Pipeline Overview

Below is a typical **CI/CD Pipeline Workflow**:

### 🔁 Step-by-Step Pipeline

1. **Code Commit (CI)**
   - Developer pushes code to a shared Git repo (e.g., GitHub).
   - The pipeline detects changes (Code Push) in the repository and triggers the CI process
     
2. **Build Phase (CI)**
   - Code is compiled and built.
   - Dependencies are resolved.
   - Output artifacts are generated and prepares the application for testing.

3. **Automated Testing (CI)**
   - Unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests are run.
   - If any test fails, the pipeline stops and the team is notified of the issues.
   - If successful, pipeline continues to the next phase.

4. **Staging Deployment (CD)**
   - Application is deployed to a **staging environment** to test deployment processes and the application’s behaviour in a production-like setup.
   - Additional tests, like performance testing or end-to-end testing, may run in this phase.

5. **Approval (for Continuous Delivery only)**
   - For Continuous Delivery, Stakeholders or release managers reviews the application and manually approve the deployment to production.
   - The pipeline halts here until approval is granted
   - Optional rollback steps are also available.

6. **Production Deployment (CD)**
   - For Continuous Deployment: if all tests are passed, the pipeline automatically deploys the application to production.
   - For Continuous Delivery: manual trigger after approval.

7. **Monitoring**
   - Logs, performance, uptime, and error tracking begins.
   - Tools alert the team in case of issues.
